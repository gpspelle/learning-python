# Perceptron neuron

This README explain what is behind a perceptron neuron.

## Perceptron neuron properties

A perceptron neuron has weights (w) for it's inputs and a bias (b). The ouput
calculated with a perceptron neuron is binary (0, 1) and depends on what weights
and bias is being used. For example:

2 inputs (x1, x2). w1 = 2, w2 = 3, bias = 3. 

output = { 1, if w1x1 + w2x2 + bias > 0;
           0, else
         }
